Grokking libbls
===============

libbls is an extremely well documented project. We did that for you! Now we
expect some feedback.

To build documentation use:

	$ scons doc

This generates documentation from Doxygen comments and places it in
doc/user/html and doc/devel/html directories. The former contains only the
public API, for libbls users, whereas the latter contains the full libbls API
for libbls developers. 

High level overview and various design documents are included in doc/devel.

The project uses Launchpad online collaboration platform
(http://launchpad.net/libbls) and the Bazaar dVCS. To check out the source code
use:

	$ bzr branch lp:libbls

The file TODO has a short list of tasks you may consider hacking on.
