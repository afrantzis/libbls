Building and installing libbls
================================

libbls uses the scons build system. To build libbls change into the
libbls directory and type::

    $ scons

To install libbls under ``/usr`` use (as root)::

    # scons install prefix=/usr 
    # ldconfig

To see all available options use::

    $ scons -h

If there are packages for your distribution or operating system it is
preferable to just use them (remember to install -dev packages!).
