Building and installing libbls
================================

libbls uses the waf build system.

First change into the libbls directory and configure it::

    $ ./waf configure [--prefix=/usr --bindings=lua]

Build with::

    $ ./waf

To install libbls use (as root)::

    # ./waf install [--destdir=DESTDIR]
    # ldconfig

To see all available options use::

    $ ./waf -h

If there are packages for your distribution or operating system it is
preferable to just use them (remember to install -dev packages!).
