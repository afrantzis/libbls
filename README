Libbls - Efficient editable buffer library
==========================================

libbls is a highly efficient, flexible and robust data manipulation library in
the form of an editable buffer. 

So, what is an editable buffer?

An editable buffer is a data structure which stores data and allows for
efficient insert, replace, delete, copy, multiple undo and redo editing
operations.  libbls does all these in a fast and memory efficient manner,
combining data from both memory and arbitrary sized chunks from files.

A simple, intuitive and yet powerful API provides the infrastructure needed to
develop scalable applications that handle large volumes of data. 

Libbls is under development. However, its main features are in usable state, so
don't hesitate to try it out and tell us what you think.

Libbls is distributed under the LGPL version 3 license (see COPYING and
COPYING.LESSER). If you find it useful, please let us know. 

If you really, really like the project, and want to contribute to it, read
HACKING or consider making a donation.

The file INSTALL contains detailed instructions for a proper libbls
installation.
