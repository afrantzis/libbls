Introduction
============

The libbls library provides an editable data buffer that can contain data from
various sources (memory, files) and provide efficient editing operations. 

The purpose of this text is to describe how to use the libbls library in your
application. It's not supposed to be a complete API reference but rather a high
level overview of the API.

For a more detailed API reference refer to the Doxygen documentation of the
public API which can be found online (http://libbls.hellug.gr) or in
doc/user/html in the libbls tarball.

Building and installing libbls
================================

Libbls uses the scons build system. To build libbls change into the libbls
directory and type::

    $ scons

To install libbls under ``/usr`` use (as root)::

    # scons install prefix=/usr 
    # ldconfig

To see all available options use::

    $ scons -h

If there are packages for your distribution or operating system it is
preferable to just use them (remember to install -dev packages!).

Using libbls in your programs 
===============================

To use libbls in your application you must include the header::

    /* Typical libbls installation */
    #include <bls/buffer.h>
               or
    /* Custom installation */
    #include "buffer.h"

Additionally you must make sure that you build your application with the
correct flags so that:

1. The header files can be found (for compilation).
2. The library can be found (for linking).
3. You use the same LFS (Large File Support) settings as libbls.

In case of a typical libbls installation all three can be automated using
pkg-config::

    pkg-config bls-0.1 --cflags
    pkg-config bls-0.1 --libs

Note that libbls versions are parallel installable. To build against another
installed version of libbls just change the version in the pkg-config command.

General API considerations
==========================

Error handling
--------------

Every function in the API returns an integer that represents the error code of
the operation that was performed. An error code of ``0`` means that the
operation completed succesfully. Any other value 
means that the operation failed. To get the string representation of an error
code use the function ``strerror()`` from the system header ``string.h``.

A typical API call with error checking will look like::

    int err;
    err = api_func();

    if (err) 
        printf("%s\n", strerror(err));

Object creation
---------------

The API is based around objects using opaque data types (usually ending in _t eg
bless_buffer_t) to increase encapsulation.

To create an object use its associated constructor functions. The constructor
functions create the object (including memory allocation) and return it to the
user by means of value-return argument (usually using a double pointer). It
is the user's responsibility to pass the address of valid pointer for the
function to store the result::

    /* prototype: int bless_buffer_new(bless_buffer_t **buf) */

    /* Correct creation. Use the address of the buf variable. */
    bless_buffer_t *buf;

    err = bless_buffer_new(&buf);

    /* 
     * Incorrect creation. dbuf doesn't point to a valid 
     * bless_buffer_t * variable.
     */
    bless_buffer_t **dbuf;

    err = bless_buffer_new(dbuf);

Out of memory situations
------------------------

libbls dutifully checks all memory allocations it makes internally and
gracefully returns ENOMEM if an allocation fails. This, of course, requires
that the underlying system can correctly inform libbls when there is not enough
memory.

Unfortunately for us, many systems use an optimistic over-committing memory
scheme when allocating memory. This means that an allocation can apparently
succeed but an access to the supposedly allocated memory may fail!

If you are planning to use libbls (or any other program for that matter) in
situations that may lead to out of memory conditions it is advisable to
disallow such overcommitting behaviour. Check your operating system's
documentation for more information on this matter.

Creating and freeing a buffer
=============================

An empty ``bless_buffer_t`` is created by using the function
``bless_buffer_new()``::
    
    int bless_buffer_new(bless_buffer_t **buf)

and freed by using the function ``bless_buffer_free()``::

    int bless_buffer_free(bless_buffer_t *buf)

For example::

    int err;
    bless_buffer_t *buf;
    
    err = bless_buffer_new(&buf);
    if (err)
       ...
    
    /* Use the buffer */
       ...
    
    /* Free the buffer */
    err = bless_buffer_free(buf);
    if (err)
       ...


Editing a buffer
================

Buffer sources
--------------

Types of buffer sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All data added to the buffer must come from some source.  Libbls abstracts
these sources using the ``bless_buffer_source_t`` opaque type.

There are currently two kinds of sources: memory sources and file sources. A
memory source represents data from a memory region. A file source represents
data from a file (regular or block device).

A file source consumes a small constant amount of memory regardless of the size
of the file or how it is used in buffers. This means that one can add large
amounts of file data into a buffer even if that data would not normally fit
into main memory. This is one of the great advantages of using libbls.

The small price to pay for this feature is that the associated file must not
change externally while the file source is still in use.


Creating a buffer source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Memory and file sources are created using functions
``bless_buffer_source_memory()`` and ``bless_buffer_source_file()``,
respectively::
                
    int bless_buffer_source_memory(bless_buffer_source_t **src, void *data, 
            size_t length, bless_mem_free_func *mem_free);
    
    int bless_buffer_source_file(bless_buffer_source_t **src, int fd, 
            bless_file_close_func *file_close);

When a source is created it may assume ownership of the related resources. That
means that it takes responsibility for all aspects of the resources' memory
management. For a memory source this means freeing the data when it is not
needed by the buffer, for a file it means closing the file. 

The source cannot magically know how to perform the cleanup actions mentioned
above. The ``mem_free`` and ``file_close`` parameters in the sources' creation
functions are used to define the function that should be called to cleanup the
resource. The cleanup function is typically one of ``free`` or ``close``
depending on the source type. It can additionally be a ``NULL`` value to denote
that no cleanup should take place when the resource is no longer needed.

The above entails that when some resource is used to create a
``bless_buffer_source_t`` and a cleanup function is given, the user must not
use or even assume the validity of any reference to that resource. This means,
for example, that if you create a memory source and you want to be able to
access the original data at all times you must either keep another copy of them
or use NULL as the ``data_free`` function.

The code snippet below shows how to create a buffer source from various
resources::

    int fd = open("myfile", O_RDONLY);
    void *smem = "LIBBLS ROCKS"
    void *mem = malloc(10);
    
    bless_buffer_source_t *mem_source;
    bless_buffer_source_t *smem_source;
    bless_buffer_source_t *file_source;
    int err;
    
    /*
     * Memory source with data from "mem". These data must
     * not be used from now on by the user.
     */
    err = bless_buffer_source_memory(&mem_source, mem, 10, free);
    if (err)
        ...
    
    /*
     * Memory source with data from "smem". These data
     * can be used by the user because they are not freed.
     * (Actually, we cannot free them anyway because they point to
     *  a static string)
     */
    err = bless_buffer_source_memory(&mem_source, smem, 14, NULL);
    if (err)
        ...
    
    /*
     * File source using file descriptor "fd". The file descriptor must not be 
     * used from now on by the user.
     */
    err = bless_buffer_source_file(&file_source, fd, close);
    if (err)
        ...	

Unreferencing a buffer source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you are done using a ``bless_buffer_source_t`` you must explicitly tell
it that you, as the user, are not planning to use it anymore. This is
accomplished using the function ``bless_buffer_source_unref()``::

    int bless_buffer_source_unref(bless_buffer_source_t *src)

For example::

    int fd = open("myfile", O_RDONLY);
    
    bless_buffer_source_t *file_source;
    
    /* Create the buffer source */
    err = bless_buffer_source_file(&file_source, fd, close);
    if (err)
        ...
    
    /* Use buffer source here */
    
    /* 
     * We are done using the buffer source. Must not use it
     * from now on.
     */
    err = bless_buffer_source_unref(file_source);
    if (err)
        ...

The function ``bless_buffer_source_unref()``, as its name suggests, does not
directly free a ``bless_buffer_source_t`` object. It just says we are not, as
users, using it anymore. The buffer source and its resources are only freed
when it is not used by neither the user nor internally in the buffers.

If the call to ``bless_buffer_source_unref()`` is forgotten, then the buffer
source will not be freed even when no buffer is using it, probably resulting in
a memory leak.

Adding data to a buffer
-----------------------

Data can be either appended to the end of a buffer or inserted in some internal
position in the buffer. These are accomplished by using the functions
``bless_buffer_append()`` and ``bless_buffer_insert()``, respectively::

    int bless_buffer_append(bless_buffer_t *buf, bless_buffer_source_t *src,
            off_t src_offset, off_t length)

    int bless_buffer_insert(bless_buffer_t *buf, off_t offset, 
            bless_buffer_source_t *src, off_t src_offset, off_t length)

As noted in the previous section data can be added only in the form of buffer
sources. 

Note that it is an error to try to insert data beyond the end of the buffer.
This means that the only way to initially add to an empty buffer is to append to
it.

For example::

    bless_buffer_t *buf;
    int err;

    err = bless_buffer_new(&buf);
    if (err)
        ...

    int fd = open("myfile", O_RDONLY);

    bless_buffer_source_t *file_source;

    /* Create the buffer source */
    err = bless_buffer_source_file(&file_source, fd, close);
    if (err)
        ...

    /* Use buffer source */
    err = bless_buffer_append(buf, file_source, 0, 10);
    if (err)
        ...

    err = bless_buffer_insert(buf, 5, file_source, 10, 20);
    if (err)
        ...

    /* 
     * We are done using the buffer source. Must not use it
     * from now on.
     */
    err = bless_buffer_source_unref(file_source);
    if (err)
        ...

Deleting data from a buffer
---------------------------

A data range can be deleted from a buffer by using the
``bless_buffer_delete()`` function::

    int bless_buffer_delete(bless_buffer_t *buf, off_t offset, off_t length)

The ``offset`` and ``length`` arguments must represent a valid range in the
buffer.

For example::

    /* Assume "buf" is initialized and contains some data */
    bless_buffer_t *buf;
    int err;

    /* Delete 10 bytes starting at offset 5 */
    err = bless_buffer_delete(buf, 5, 10);
    if (err)
        ...


Reading data from the buffer
============================

Data from the buffer is read by copying it to user-provided memory area.  This
is accomplished by using the function ``bless_buffer_read()``::

    int bless_buffer_read(bless_buffer_t *src, off_t src_offset, void *dst,
            size_t dst_offset, size_t length)

For example::

    /* Assume "buf" is initialized and contains some data */
    bless_buffer_t *buf;
    int err;

    void *mem = malloc(13);

    /* 
     * Read 10 bytes starting at offset 5 in the buffer and store them in memory
     * area starting at "mem" + 3.
     */
    err = bless_buffer_read(buf, 5, mem, 3, 10);
    if (err)
        ...

Saving the buffer contents to a file
====================================

The whole buffer contents can be saved to a user-provided file by using the
``bless_buffer_save()`` function::

 int bless_buffer_save(bless_buffer_t *buf, int fd, bless_progress_func *func)

The file descriptor ``fd`` must be opened with write permission.

*[Progress callback not implemented yet, details may change]*
The ``func`` function, if it is not NULL, is periodically called from within the
save function to report the progress of the save operation. Its return value is
checked by the save function to determine if the save should continue or not.
Note, that the save function is free to ignore the cancel request if that would
leave the saved file in an incosistent state.

Note that in some situations, if the buffer contains data from the target file
of the save operation, additional temporary storage space may be needed. Main
memory is utilized first, followed by temporary files on disk, if memory is not
sufficient.

An example of how to save a buffer::

    /* Assume "buf" is initialized and contains some data */
    bless_buffer_t *buf;
    int err;

    int wfd = creat("target", 0644);

    /* 
     * Save buffer contents to a file
     */
    err = bless_buffer_save(buf, wfd, NULL);
    if (err)
        ...
