This directory contains some use cases for libbless in the form of C source
files. Their purpose is to help us develop an insight into the usefulness and
elegance of the API. They can also serve as examples of how to use the API.

NOTE: The files are not meant to be an implementation test and therefore are
neither complete nor compilable.
