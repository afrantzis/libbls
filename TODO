== Small Sized Tasks ==

* Implement support for progress callback functions in bless_buffer_save().

* Add support for also using files as temporary storage when saving and we 
  don't have enough memory.
  See src/buffer_file.c: break_edge() 
  and src/buffer_util.c: segcol_store_in_memory()

* [In-progress] Create programs to check performance scaling and memory leaks
  in the library.

== Medium Sized Tasks ==

* Implement bless_buffer_find(). Use Boyer-Moore algorithm for searching.

== Large Sized Tasks ==

* Implement undo/redo (and related functions) for buffers.

* Use a more efficient data structure to implement the Segment Collection.
  See doc/devel/segcol_data_structure.txt for some ideas.
